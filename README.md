# BKWLD Photoshop Actions


### Save layer for web

Actions that help you create sprites from a PSD.  I use these all the time and have them mapped to F1 and F2, respectively.

* Normal - Creates a new document with your layer, crops it to the minimum size that will contain the contents of the layer, then prompt save for web.
* Double - Same as normal, but doubles the image size of the new document first.  Great for creating retina versions of assets that are shapes or smart objects.
